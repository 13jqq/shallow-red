A Pokemon Showdown AI that uses Monte Carlo tree search with Exp3 to make moves. It is assumed that both players have access to both team sheets. Right now it only supports 2v2 doubles with no switching.

Requires the modified PS server from [https://github.com/samhippie/Pokemon-Showdown](https://github.com/samhippie/Pokemon-Showdown). Make sure you run `npm install` in the PS server directory before running this program.

The algorithms used mainly come from [http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf](http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf).
