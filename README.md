A Pokemon Showdown AI that uses Monte Carlo tree search to make moves. It is assumed that both players have access to both team sheets. Right now it only supports the 1v1 format.

Requires the modified PS server from [https://github.com/samhippie/Pokemon-Showdown](https://github.com/samhippie/Pokemon-Showdown). Make sure you run `npm install` in the PS server directory before running this program.

The algorithms used mainly come from [http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf](http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/cig14-smmctsggp.pdf).
